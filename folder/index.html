                <p> I chose to do the project on Anne Bonny. I don’t exactly admire Anne just think she interesting. 
                    Anne Bonney was a female pirate in the 1700’s which is cool because there were not a lot of female pirates. 
                    Another reason I found her interesting is because before she killed her victems she had showed them her breast. 
                    She did this so  they knew they were killed by a women. The last reason I find Anne interesting is because it was rumored she was queer. 
                    It was said she had a relatship wuth antor female pirate Mary Read. To rap this up the reason why I “adimre” Anne Bonny is because she was a boss queer female.
